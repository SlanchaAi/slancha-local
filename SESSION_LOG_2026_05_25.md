## Mesh tailnet heartbeat fix (producer side) — implemented

**Goal:** library improvements to slancha-local per
`docs/MESH_TAILNET_FIX_2026_05_25.md`. slancha-local is the mesh heartbeat
*producer*; it advertised the loopback bind address, unreachable from the
cloud gateway that now dials home nodes over a Tailscale/Headscale tailnet
by MagicDNS.

### What shipped

- **`config.py`** — `mesh_advertise_host: str | None` (env
  `SLANCHA_MESH_ADVERTISE_HOST`). None → auto-discover MagicDNS.
- **`mesh/heartbeat.py`** — `parse_magicdns_name`, `resolve_magicdns_name`,
  `resolve_advertise_host`, `build_node_url`, `specialists_from_models`.
  Mirrors `slancha-mesh/mesh/tailnet.py` but re-implemented (heartbeat.py
  carries no slancha-mesh dependency, by design). Never-raise subprocess
  contract.
- **`capability/probe.py`** — `cached()` sync accessor (heartbeat runs in a
  daemon thread, can't `await get()`).
- **`proxy/main.py`** — `build_heartbeat_loop()` + a FastAPI `lifespan`.
  Opt-in via `SLANCHA_MESH_REGISTRY_URL`; warms the capability cache, starts
  the daemon thread, stops on shutdown. When mesh is off (default) the loop
  is disabled and no `tailscale` subprocess runs on boot.
- **`tests/test_mesh_tailnet.py`** — 17 tests (TDD; red→green). Full suite
  251 passed / 25 skipped (skips pre-existing: libomp + slancha-mesh absent).

### Decisions / surprises

- **Blocker not in the draft:** `MeshHeartbeatLoop` was defined + tested but
  **never instantiated** — `mesh_lifespan.py` was gone (stale `.pyc` only),
  `main.py` imported only `MeshAuthMiddleware`. Mesh heartbeat was dead code.
  Wiring it was the load-bearing part of the fix; #1/#3 are necessary but
  not sufficient without it.
- **Dropped doc fix #2** (per-specialist `node_url`). Topology verified from
  code: slancha-local is a single-endpoint proxy (router dials one
  `/v1/chat/completions`; backend selection is internal via
  `mesh_fallback`/`LocalCatalog`). Per-specialist URLs only matter for the
  bare-model-server producer (`mesh.serve --tailnet`) — different repo.
- **Verified end-to-end** with a one-shot capture listener: heartbeat POST
  carried `node_url=http://gb10.taila93596.ts.net:8055` (advertise host, not
  loopback) + `loaded_models` from the live catalog.

### Known follow-ups (NOT done — separate items)

1. **Rules classifier mispick:** with libomp missing the ML classifier is
   disabled; rules-fallback picks the *first local* model = an embedder
   (`nomic-embed-text`) for chat → no `choices`. `catalog_fn` has the same
   blind spot (advertises embedders as general specialists). Fix: filter to
   chat-capable models.
2. **Advertised-id vs dispatch scheme:** `/v1/models` advertises
   `ollama:qwen3:14b` but the dispatcher wants `local:ollama:qwen3:14b`
   (`unknown target scheme: ollama`).
3. **Pre-existing ruff in `heartbeat.py`** (unused `sys`/`time`,
   `datetime.UTC`, `Callable` placement) — left untouched (surgical); all
   `ruff --fix`-able.

## X-Slancha-Pref acceptance (slancha-api routing rules) — implemented

**Goal:** let slancha-local accept the same agent-written routing rules
slancha-api added — the price/accuracy/latency weight simplex + flat levers
(`app/mesh/pref.py`, `SlanchaPref`), via `X-Slancha-Pref` header or `pref`
JSON body.

**Found:** the plumbing already existed — `ClassifyRequest.preferences` is
consumed by the local selector (`classifier/local.py`: escalation, ctx,
caps) and forwarded to the cloud classifier — but `chat.py` hardcoded
`Preferences()` (default), so client preference input was silently ignored.

**Shipped:**
- `proxy/pref.py` (new) — `parse_pref_header` (RFC 8941 dict SUBSET, no
  `http_sfv` dep), `SlanchaPrefInput` (weights validation mirrors
  slancha-api; `extra="ignore"` so the full gateway shape is accepted not
  rejected), `resolve_preferences` (header+body merge, body wins).
- `proxy/models.py` — `pref: dict | None` on `ChatCompletionRequest`.
- `proxy/chat.py` — resolve from header+body, map onto `Preferences`; bad
  input → 422 (same contract as the gateway).
- `tests/test_pref.py` — 15 tests.

**Mapping (slancha-api → local `Preferences`):** `weights{price,accuracy,
latency}` → normalized `cost/quality/latency_weight` (privacy→0);
`max_latency_ms_p95`→`max_latency_ms`; `max_cost_per_1m_usd`→`max_cost_per_1k`
(÷1000 unit convert); `allow_fallbacks`→`escalation_allowed`. Gateway-only
concerns (admin ceiling, provider translation, service-tier presets) NOT
ported — they belong at the gateway.

**Verified live:** bad weights axis → 422; valid `allow-fallbacks=?0` header
with no local backends → 503 reject (escalation suppressed) — proves the
rule reaches the selector and changes behavior, not just parsed. Full suite
266 passed / 25 skipped.

**Follow-ups:** surface applied weights in the `slancha-decision-trace`
header (format_trace signature change); the local rules-selector uses
`escalation_allowed` strongly but doesn't yet rank on the cost/quality/
latency weights (cloud classifier does). Header parser is a documented
flat-scalar subset; nested values come via the JSON body.

## Detour (not the task)

Earlier in the session I mis-read "run the project" as "stand up a serving
demo" and wired slancha-local → spark-472e ollama (`qwen3:14b`) over the
tailnet to prove a round-trip. That exposed follow-ups #1 and #2 above but
was not the actual ask (library improvements). Serve process killed.
